Heat Mode (we want 104)

1. run filtration pump (main pump for 20 seconds)
2. read input from temperature sensors
3. decide whether heater needs to be on/off (104 or greater don't run at all)
4. if 'on' then turn on circulation pump first (2 seconds before heater), then turn on heater
5. if 'off' then go to step 8
6. run heater for a set amount of time based on starting temperature (100-103 degrees = 20 min, 98-100 = 1hr, <98 = 1.5 hr)
7. start over at step 1
8. wait 1.5 hrs then repeat step 1

Away Mode (we want 98)

1. run filtration pump (main pump for 20 seconds)
2. read input from temperature sensors
3. decide whether heater needs to be on/off (98 or greater don't run at all)
4. if 'on' then turn on circulation pump first (2 seconds before heater), then turn on heater
5. if 'off' then go to step 8
6. run heater for 20 min
7. start over at step 1
8. wait 1.5 hrs then repeat step 1
